                <h2>
                    WHAT IS THE PRICE RANGE OF YOUR DRESSES?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently our gowns range from $200 to $8000. The majority of our gowns are between $2500 to
                    $5500.
                    We do not have traditional "sales" on our dresses at any time. We have trunk show incentives for
                    a
                    specific designer once or twice a year, which usually offer 10% off during the trunk show
                    weekend
                    only. We occasionally have sample sales once a year, but the only gowns discounted are our
                    actual
                    sample dresses that have been tried on before that we are now selling off the rack.

                <h2>
                    WILL I NEED ALTERATIONS?
                </h2>
                <p>Yes! And you will be so happy you finally got something fitted perfectly for you. Alterations are
                    an essential finishing touch to any gown. Alterations will make the gown truly yours. When
                    purchasing a dress, we take your measurements to order you your standard size. However,
                    alterations are needed to fine tune. Whether that means taking in a dress to make it smaller for
                    your hips, bust, or waist (or maybe everywhere), add cups, shorten straps, hem the length, and
                    add the bustle for your train. Alterations are just a standard part of the whole process, and
                    nothing to stress over! You will be so happy with the magic a talented, reputable seamstress can
                    do. We currently offer a list of seamstresses you can consider working with, but our brides do
                    not have to use these fit specialists. We leave the final choice of who will alter your gown up
                    to you! We also recommend budgeting $500 to $800 for alterations with most seamstresses. The
                    pricing can change dramatically depending on where you live. Some cities are more or less
                    expensive than others as we all know!

                <h2>
                    DOES THE PRICE INCLUDE ALTERATIONS?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No, the prices our gowns are listed at do not include alterations or any other charges like tax,
                    special sizes or cup sizes, special/custom length, shipping, or rush charges.

                <h2>
                    SHOULD I DO MY ALTERATIONS WITH YOUR SEAMSTRESS?

                </h2>
                <p>Talk with our stylists when you gown arrives to discuss the best plan of your time, schedule,
                    budget, or other needs. If you do not live near our boutiques, we highly, highly recommend doing
                    alterations where you live or somewhere near where you live instead. Why? Brides need multiple
                    fittings (brides should plan on 2-4 fittings with a seamstress and the number of fittings cannot
                    be guaranteed before) and the constant back and forth travel before the wedding can end up being
                    a huge stress and expense. We would love to provide guidance on how to find a talented
                    seamstress near you or we may even have recommendations already depending on where you live!

                <h2>
                    WHO SHOULD I BRING ALONG TO SHOP WITH?

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes less is more! We don't always agree with that, but when it comes to your wedding dress
                    shopping we do! We often see brides having the best and easiest time with smaller parties. Of
                    course everyone is unique and different, but having more than five people with your is often
                    more stressful and less fun than one would've think. We're just trying to help a sister out!
                    Smaller groups allow you to actually be able to listen to yourself, your opinions, and how you
                    feel. And that is the most important and indispensable opinion. You will hear a lot of opinions,
                    but your opinion is the most valuable. You've got to trust your gut! We've seen a few too many
                    brides in tears when friends and family forget who the appointment and shopping is for. You are
                    the one who has to wear the dress and look at your photos in your dress forever! You should love
                    it! On top of that, our boutiques are quaint and cozy. If you choose to bring more than five
                    people, your friends and family may feel a cramped. Our boutiques (especially Seattle)
                    accommodate groups of 4-6 most comfortably.
